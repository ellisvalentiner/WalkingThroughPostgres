Write-Up:
PostgreSQL is a powerful, free, and open source object-relational database system with a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance. This talk will introduce the Postgres database system and walkthrough creating and administering a Postgres cluster, loading and querying the data, and show case some of Postgres's lesser known and differentiating features. During the presentation we'll setup new Postgres databases on a local computer and on a remote server. Using real data, we'll see how to populate a database, how to configure access, and how to execute basic and more complex queries.
