# Postgres is


--

- ### an object relational database management system

--

- ### open source

--

- ### conforms to at least 160 out of 179 the SQL:2011 features

--

- ### also supports NoSQL

--

- ### extendable

--

- ### free as in freedom

--

- ### free as in price

???

SQL:2011 (or ISO/IEC 9075:2011) is the seventh revision of the ISO (1987) and ANSI (1986) standard

SQL:2016 is the latest, which added more optional features, but I couldn't find data available for that

PostgreSQL tries to conform with the SQL standard where such conformance does not contradict traditional features or could lead to poor architectural decisions.

"no relational database meets full conformance with this standard" -- postgres.com

# Background

### We have a client who monitors DNS queries on their network to block malicious traffic.

--

### Our client wants a database to store DNS queries.

--

### Finally, our client wants to query the database for all DNS queries to hosts outside of North America.

# Our Tasks

--
### 1. Create a new Postgres database

--

### 2. Create a new schema and tables

--

### 3. Load historic data from the client

--

### 4. Query the database

--

### 5. ???

### 6. Profit
